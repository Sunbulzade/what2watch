# What2Watch - Demo Presentation Q&A

*Questions and answers designed for a live demo presentation where the audience can see the application running but not the source code.*

## General Project Overview

### Q1: What is What2Watch and what problem does it solve?
**A:** What2Watch is a personalized movie recommendation web application that solves the common problem of "I don't know what to watch." It combines an extensive movie database with AI-powered recommendations to help users discover movies that match their preferences. Users can search through thousands of movies, get AI-powered suggestions through a chat interface, and manage their personal watchlist and liked movies.

### Q2: Who is your target audience?
**A:** Our target audience includes movie enthusiasts who struggle to find new content, casual viewers looking for personalized suggestions, and anyone who wants to organize their movie-watching experience. The application serves both tech-savvy users who enjoy AI interactions and traditional users who prefer simple browsing and search.

### Q3: What makes your application unique compared to existing movie platforms?
**A:** What2Watch stands out by combining traditional movie browsing with AI-powered conversational recommendations. Unlike Netflix or IMDb, we offer a personal AI assistant that understands natural language queries like "I want something like Inception but lighter" and provides tailored suggestions with explanations. We also focus on discovery rather than streaming, making it platform-agnostic.

## Technology Stack & Architecture

### Q4: What technologies did you choose for this project and why?
**A:** We built What2Watch using Next.js 15 for the full-stack framework, which gives us both frontend React components and backend API capabilities in one application. We chose PostgreSQL for our database because it handles complex relationships well and supports array data types for movie genres. For AI features, we integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 for structured recommendations and Ollama for local AI chat functionality.

### Q5: How did you handle the large amount of movie data?
**A:** We implemented a dual database approach. We have our main application database managed by Prisma ORM for user data, watchlists, and user-movie relationships. Additionally, we integrate with an external movie database containing thousands of movie records. This separation allows us to efficiently handle both user interactions and large-scale movie data without performance issues.

### Q6: Can you explain your authentication system?
**A:** We implemented secure user authentication using NextAuth.js with credential-based login. User passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security. The system includes protected routes, so users must log in to access features like watchlists, recommendations, and profile management. Sessions persist across browser refreshes, and we have proper logout functionality.

## User Interface & Experience

### Q7: How did you design the user interface to be user-friendly?
**A:** We designed a clean, modern interface using a mobile-first approach. On mobile devices, users get a bottom navigation bar for easy thumb access, while desktop users see a traditional top navigation. We used consistent colors, proper spacing, and clear visual hierarchy. The interface adapts smoothly between screen sizes, and we included loading states and feedback messages to keep users informed.

### Q8: Walk us through the main features a user can access.
**A:** Users start on our homepage where they can browse featured movies. They can search for specific movies or browse by genre in the Movies section. The Recommendations page features our AI chat assistant where users can describe what they're looking for and get personalized suggestions. Users can add movies to their watchlist, like movies, and manage everything from their profile page.

### Q9: How does the search functionality work?
**A:** Our search system works on multiple levels. Users can search by movie titles, and the system provides real-time results as they type. We also support genre-based filtering and can search across multiple movie attributes. The search integrates with our AI system, so users can use natural language queries in the chat interface to find movies based on mood, themes, or specific preferences.

## AI Integration & Recommendations

### Q10: How does your AI recommendation system work?
**A:** We have two AI systems working together. For structured movie recommendations, we use OpenAI's GPT-4, which analyzes user queries and returns specific movie suggestions with reasons why each movie matches their request. For conversational interactions, we use a local AI model through Ollama, allowing users to chat naturally about their movie preferences and get immediate responses.

### Q11: Can you demonstrate the AI chat feature?
**A:** *[Demo the chat interface]* Users can type questions like "I want a sci-fi movie that's not too complicated" or "Recommend something similar to The Matrix but from the last 5 years." The AI understands context, asks clarifying questions when needed, and provides thoughtful recommendations with explanations. The chat maintains conversation history, so users can refine their requests.

### Q12: How accurate are your recommendations?
**A:** Our AI system is trained on extensive movie knowledge and understands genres, themes, directors, and movie relationships. The recommendations become more accurate as users interact more with the system. We also allow users to like/dislike recommendations, and the AI learns from the broader conversation context to provide increasingly personalized suggestions.

### Q13: What happens if the AI doesn't understand a request?
**A:** Our AI is designed to ask clarifying questions when requests are unclear. If a user asks something too vague, the AI will respond with follow-up questions like "What genre are you in the mood for?" or "Do you prefer recent movies or classics?" The system is also constrained to only discuss movies, so it politely redirects off-topic conversations back to film recommendations.

## Data Management & Performance

### Q14: How do you handle the performance with thousands of movies?
**A:** We implement several performance optimizations: pagination for large result sets, efficient database indexing for fast searches, and strategic data loading. We only load movie details when needed and use image optimization for posters. The search results are ranked by relevance, so users see the most appropriate matches first.

### Q15: How do you manage user data and privacy?
**A:** User data security is a priority. Passwords are encrypted before storage, user sessions are managed securely, and we only store necessary personal information. For the local AI chat feature, conversations can be processed locally without sending sensitive data to external services, giving users privacy options.

### Q16: What happens if external services are unavailable?
**A:** We built redundancy into the system. If the OpenAI service is unavailable, users can still browse movies and use basic search. If the local AI model isn't running, the chat gracefully shows an error message with instructions. The core movie browsing and watchlist features work independently of AI services.

## Future Development & Scalability

### Q17: What features would you add next?
**A:** Future enhancements would include user rating systems, social features for sharing recommendations with friends, integration with streaming platforms to show where movies are available, and more advanced AI features like mood-based recommendations or learning from viewing history patterns.

### Q18: How would you scale this application for more users?
**A:** For scaling, we would implement caching systems for frequently accessed movie data, database connection pooling, and possibly move to a microservices architecture. We could also implement user preference learning algorithms and add recommendation engines beyond just AI-based suggestions.

### Q19: What challenges did you face during development?
**A:** Main challenges included integrating multiple data sources efficiently, ensuring the AI provides relevant and accurate recommendations, handling different user input patterns in the chat interface, and maintaining good performance with large datasets. We also had to balance feature richness with simplicity in the user interface.

### Q20: What did you learn from building this project?
**A:** This project taught us about full-stack development, AI integration, database design for complex relationships, and user experience design. We learned how to work with modern web technologies, handle real-time interactions, and create systems that are both powerful and user-friendly. The experience also showed us the importance of planning for scalability and maintaining clean, maintainable code.

## Technical Deep Dive (For Technical Audience)

### Q21: Why did you choose Next.js over other frameworks?
**A:** Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with built-in API routes, server-side rendering, and automatic optimization. The App Router gives us file-based routing, and the full-stack nature means we can handle both frontend and backend in one codebase. The deployment and performance optimizations are also excellent.

### Q22: How do you handle real-time features?
**A:** While our current version focuses on request-response interactions, the chat interface provides immediate feedback and maintains conversation state. For future real-time features, Next.js supports WebSocket connections and real-time updates through various integration options.

### Q23: What's your database design approach?
**A:** We designed our database with clear relationships between users and movies using many-to-many associations for watchlists, liked movies, and watched movies. This allows efficient queries and maintains data integrity. The separation between user data and movie catalog data allows for independent scaling and optimization.

### Q24: How do you ensure application security?
**A:** Security measures include encrypted password storage, session-based authentication, input validation on all forms, protection against common web vulnerabilities, and secure API endpoints. We also implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive system information.

### Q25: What's your approach to testing and quality assurance?
**A:** We implement comprehensive error handling, user input validation, and test the application across different devices and browsers. The modular component structure makes it easier to test individual features, and we validate both the AI responses and database operations for reliability.
